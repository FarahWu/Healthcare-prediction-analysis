# Healthcare-prediction-analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart diseases using machine learning models. By leveraging healthcare data, we aim to develop an AI-powered system to assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.
## Dataset
### Dataset : Heart Disease Dataset
### This dataset contains medical records of patients with various attributes, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, which are used to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
## Objectives
### -Analyze healthcare data to identify risk factors for heart disease.
### -Apply machine learning models for predictive analysis.
### -Evaluate model performance to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
